# Lugs

A modern, fast, local transcription app for the hearing impaired.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Currently, Lugs is only available for MacOS and Windows, with Linux support coming soon.
* Lugs requires a microphone to be connected to your computer.

### Installing

* Head to [lugs.ai](https://lugs.ai) and download the latest version of Lugs for your operating system. Alternatively, you can download the latest version from the Lug repository on this organisation.

### Known limitations
1. Currently, you can only use Lugs in English.
2. Lugs cannot intercept MacOS system audio by default due to Apple security restrictions. To enable this requires installing a loopback audio device in safe mode which requires external software. This is not ideal, and we're working on a solution.
